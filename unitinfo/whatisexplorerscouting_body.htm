<h2>What is Explorer Scouting?</h2>
<h3>What are Explorer Scouts?</h3>
<p>If you're 14 to 18 years old and want to enjoy Scouting you can do so by
joining Explorer Scouting. As an Explorer Scout you get to take part in all the
usual great Scouting activities such as kayaking, climbing, orienteering,
caving, camping... as well as work on projects helping to support your local
community.</p>
<p>You can also, if you choose, get more closely involved in working with the
younger sections as a Young Leader.</p>
<p>The Duke of Edinburgh's Award is a voluntary, non competitive programme of
practical, cultural and adventurous activities, designed to support the personal
and social development of young people aged 14-25, regardless of gender,
background or ability. It offers an individual challenge and encourages young
people to undertake exciting, constructive, challenging and enjoyable activities
in their free time.</p>
<p>If you're an Explorer Scout or Network member you can work on the Duke of
Edinburgh's Award Scheme at the same time that you're working for your Chief
Scout's Platinum, Diamond or Queen's Scout Award. Two Awards for the price of
one - can't be bad!</p>
<h4>How did Explorer Scouting begin?</h4>
<p>Scouting has always been a dynamic and forward-looking Movement. In the early
days of Scouting, Lord Baden-Powell saw the need to provide a programme for
young people who wanted to continue after their time in the Scout Section.
Senior Scouts was developed to meet this need, and the Section continued to
evolve over the years.</p>
<p>In 1967, Venture Scouting was formed from the existing Senior Scout and Rover
Scout Sections. During the late 1990s, it was decided that, in order to meet the
changing needs of new generations, two new Sections should be created for young
people over the age of fourteen. Explorer Scouts for 14 to 18-year-olds and the
Scout Network for 18 to 25-year-olds were created.</p>
<h4>The Structure of Explorer Scouting</h4>
<p>The Explorer section is run by the Scout District and not any one particular
Scout Group. The Explorer Unit has Explorer Leaders and they are responsible for
the week to week running of the Unit. They report to the District Explorer Scout
Commissioner and the District Commissioner. Many Explorer Units meet in a Scout
hut owned by one particular Scout Group &ndash; this generally occurs in order
to get access to a meeting place. FreeSpirit Explorer Unit has members from
every Scout Group in Torfaen and encourages this non discriminatory Moving On
process.</p>
