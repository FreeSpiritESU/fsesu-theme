<h3>History of FreeSpirit ESU</h3>
<p>FreeSpirit Explorer Scout Unit was officially formed and
            began meeting regularly (once a week) in September 2003. In the Spring of 2003,
            Simon (a former leader from Essex), Richard (a former Torfaen Venture Scout)
            and Tim (an active dad and holder of the Gold Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award) had
            been approached by Leaders from 1<sup>st</sup> Henllys and the District
            Commissioner at that time (Steve Crowley) to consider opening and running a
            District Explorer Unit in Cwmbran. Henllys Scouts had 7 lads who had turned 14
            or would very shortly, were keen and had no ware else to go. Explorers had
            recently been launched nationally by The Scout Association and were essentially
            replacing the old Venture Scout section.</p>

<p>At a meeting on the 14<sup>th</sup> July on an incredibly
            hot evening, the founder members (James, Sam, Jake, Dewi, Ieuan, Kev and Dan
            together with leaders Tim and Simon) put together the fundamental requirements
            that became FreeSpirit Explorers &ndash; the Unit name was decided (nothing to do
            with any scout group in Torfaen because all were welcome); the unit colours
            were debated (red and black); the unit logo was scribbled, re drawn and finally
            decided (a crow flying over Twmbarlwm &ndash; Cwmbran means &ldquo;valley of the crows&rdquo; and
            Twmbarlwm is our local hill); a regular meeting place was discussed (Glen Llwyd
            Scout Hut); Summer Camp 2004 was decided (Essex Jamboree); and draft
            Partnership Agreements were laid out to formally recognise the support of 1<sup>st</sup> Henllys and Glen Llwyd scout groups.</p>

<p>During September 03, Rachel (Richards&rsquo;s sister) joined us
            from Panteg Scouts and Richard from 1<sup>st</sup> Pontnewydd. From this core
            group of 9 explorer scouts FreeSpirit has evolved into a unit with over 35
            members and representatives from every scout group in Torfaen District. We Camp
            at least one weekend every month and for at least 1 week during August. The
            unit endeavours to hold one major camp abeoad every 2 years. During our
            centenary year, 2007, 24 young people and 4 leaders attended the World jamboree
            &ndash; the largest single unit representation in the world!</p>
