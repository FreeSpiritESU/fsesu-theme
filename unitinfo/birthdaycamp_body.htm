<h2>FreeSpirit 10 Year Birthday Camp</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>When :</strong>&nbsp;30 August - 01 September 2013</p>
<p><strong>Where :</strong>&nbsp; Botany Bay Activity Centre, Botany Bay, Trelleck Road, Tintern, Chepstow, NP16 6SN</p>
<p><strong>Cost :</strong>&nbsp;&pound;40&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Birthday Camp to celebrate 10 years of FreeSpirit Explorers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*******UPDATE*********</p>
<p>Due to limited sign up for this event we have had to rethink it.</p>
<p>We will now be camping at Botany Bay Scout Campsite near Tintern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dates remain the same 30/08/13 - 01/09/13 but arriving Friday evening instead of morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan is to have lots of different activities followed by a Hog roast and party on the Saturday night. Sunday will be a Big Boy Breakfast in true FreeSpirit Style followed by more activities.</p>
<p>The cost will be reduced to &pound;40 for the full weekend. This will cover camping fee, activities and full catering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to see as many FreeSpirits as possible, so if you can only make part of the weekend you are still more than welcome. Whether it's for a day, an evening or just an hour, please contact us so we can arrange what cost (if any) will be involved.</p>
<p>If you have already sent in your form and paid the original &pound;40 we will consider you coming and fully paid unless you tell us otherwise.</p>
<p>If you have not booked please download and fill out the booking form from the link below and return with &pound;40 by FRIDAY 19th JULY</p>
