            <h3>Code Of Conduct</h3>
            <p>This "Code of Conduct" document was written and compiled 
            by the founding members of FreeSpirit Explorers in 2003. 
            It has been reviewed and updated, where appropiate, annually
            since that date.</p>
            
            
            <p>These guidelines describe what actions, language and
            dress code that the Unit Members feel is acceptable and,
            what is not acceptable. The code of conduct covers the 
            following aspects: </p>
            <ul class='cofc'>

            </ul>
            
            
            <p>The guidelines list the action that will be taken if these
            rules are broken or ignored by any member.</p>
