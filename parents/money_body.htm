<h2>Money Matters</h2>
</div>
<p>Running an Explorer Unit and carrying out an exciting Explorer 
            programme costs money. The Unit does fundraise by its members taking 
            part in various activities e.g. bag packing. Any young person who 
            regularly takes part in these activities will typically have reduced 
            payments on camps. The Unit also regularly subsidises the weekly 
            programme.</p>
<p>We charge a termly subscription of &pound;25.00. This is payable 
            (by cheque please to FreeSpirit Explorers with name and what for 
            written on the back) during the first few weeks of every term. If 
            you are a new starter, the first half term is always free.</p>
<p>Our annual camp typically has a staggered payment plan. This is 
            issued well in advance and we ask that you adhere to the published 
            dates.</p>
<p>Upon investiture into the Unit, your son / daughter will receive 
            a Unit necker and woggle together with a number of badges that will 
            require sewing to their shirt at no cost.</p>
<p>This Unit operates an equal opportunities policy in that we believe 
            that no child should be excluded from an activity because of financial 
            constraint (within reason). Please do not hesitate in discussing any 
            issues or concerns that you may have, in total confidence.</p>
